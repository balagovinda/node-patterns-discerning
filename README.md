## Node.js Patterns for the Discerning Developer

Code samples from my talk at OSCON 2014.

Check out slides from the talk here: http://www.slideshare.net/cacois/nodejs-patterns-for-discerning-developers

Also, check out my scale-fs module, built using the presented patterns (request batching/caching) for high-concurrency file I/O: https://www.npmjs.org/package/scale-fs

You can install it using NPM:

> npm install scale-fs
